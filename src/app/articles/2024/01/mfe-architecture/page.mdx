There are many different ways to structure and plan out any software that you build. Some ways are better than others and many times it is problem specific for which one is best.

One of those options has come to be known as microfrontend architecture and thatâ€™s the one we are going to focus on.

## What is microfrontend architecture?

Microfrontend architecture is very much so just like it sounds. Much like a micro-service backend architecture, it breaks up the application into smaller, more manageable codebases. Allowing for loosely coupled microfrontends makes it easier and safer to deploy. Microfrontends can be split up by the paths on the same domain, or even smaller sections to have multiple microfrontends on the same page.

This separation has many advantages:

- Allowing separate teams to control their deployment process
